# google-homepage


The very first project from [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)


Clone of Google Homepage. I used Grid Layout. 
My biggest frustration was to gt rid of a blank space in the right bottom corner. Added `main` to html helped to solved (forgotten to put it there in the first place).
