# google-homepage


The very first project from [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)


Clone of Google Homepage. I used Grid Layout. 
My biggest frustration was to gt rid of a blank space in the right bottom corner. Added `main` to html helped to solved (forgotten to put it there in the first place). 

Also, I learned how to use `background` property in the css when adding small image.
```
background: bg-color bg-image position/bg-size bg-repeat bg-origin bg-clip bg-attachment 
```
I learned that to change position and size of the image in the shorthand declaration I must use a / (slash).
So, for example `right center/15px` means that the picture will be moved to the right center and the image size will be 15px. 


>10px 20px/50px 50px` will result in a background image, positioned 10 pixels from the left, 20 pixels from the top, and the size of the image will be 50 pixels wide and 50 pixels high.
